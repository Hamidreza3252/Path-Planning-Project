    "\n",
    "Kalman filter is an iterative mathematical process that uses a set of equations and consecutive data inputs to quickly estimate the true value, position, velocity, etc. of the object being measured, when the measured values contain unpredicted or random error, uncertainty, or variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process, we start with an initial estimate of a measurement, with certain amount of error or uncertainty. As we receive more data inputs and we go through this iterative process, the Kalman Filter’s estimated value narrows down close to the actual value of the measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main calculations that need to be done iteratively: \n",
    "1. Calculate the Kalman Gain \n",
    "2. Calculate the current estimate \n",
    "3. Calculate the new error (uncertainty) in the new estimate \n",

    "  Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion of observations within a data set. For example, Standard deviation means that about $2/3$ of the values reside within $\\bar {x} \\pm \\sigma_{x}$;  \n",
    "  Variance is a numerical value that describes the variability of observations from its arithmetic mean.  \n",
    "\n",

    ">Subjectively, Standard deviation is more preferable to use rathen than variance. However, expressing the equations in matrix form will lead to appearance of variance at the elements of covariance matrix. The diagonal elmenets are the same as squared of standard deviation, i.e. $\\sigma_{x}^2$, $\\sigma_{y}^2$, etc. However, the off-diagonal elements will reveal additional information about the relative spread of the data across two axes.

The Kalman gain is a means to assign a weight factor into 'estimation' and 'measured value' (as discussed above). An example of the discrepancy between the measurement and prediction is the error due the delay in measurement process, e.g. by the time we measure a distance of a satellite, it may have moved from the original position. It should be noted that observation provides valuable source of information and we should not simply miss it because of over-confidence in our prediction step.

    "# 2. Extended Kalman Filter and Sensor Fusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we may have to deal with updating the states based on the measuremrnts received from multiple sensors, reporting the same type of information (e.g. position and velocity), but in different formats. Therefore, Extended Kalman Filter process is introduced to handle more complex motion and measurement models. For example, to track an object, we can use two sensors, a Radar and a Lidar (or a laser sensor). The measurement-update step depends on the sensor type; Radar measurement involves a nonlinear measurement function, as opposed to the linear function discused above. In this framework, each sensor has its own prediction update scheme and the process continues asynchronously, the same as before, even if we receive several measurements at the same time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2-1. Introducing Nonlinear Terms  \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of Kalman filter is to be able to fuse sensor readings from different sources. Each sensor may work differently, providing different outputs. For example, Lidar sensor can provide rather high-resolution information about position of an object (not velocity). On the other hand, Radar sensor can directly measure and provide the radial velocity of a moving object (using Doppler effect), but at lower spacial resolution as compared to Lidar/laser sensor data. Using extended Kalman filter process, we can fuse the different measurements received from these two sensors, but with different mapping functions. In this section, we take Radar sensor measurement example to derive the extended Kalman filter equations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction step remains the same for both radar and laser sensors; But for the radar sensor, we need a nonlinear fucntion $h(X)$ to map the states into the sensor measurement space. For radar measurement mapping, $h(X)$ is defined as below:  \n",
